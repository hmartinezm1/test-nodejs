Project Development Plan for Sprint I
=====================================

  The first sprint of the project will be focused on  the App GUI Mockup and developing
the Database to be used for the app. PostgreSQL will be used as the Database for storing 
all the data of the application and Heroku will be used as the server to deploy the application. 

  There will be at least 2 group meetings during the 2 weeks for the first sprint. The 
first meeting will be on September 17. In the meeting we’ll be discussing the Database,
ER mapping, Mock App Design  and the Gantt chart. For the second meeting, on September 24,
we’ll be reviewing the mock app design, finishing touches on the database and discussing 
the second sprint.
