Project Development Plan for Sprint II
======================================
  The first sprint of the project will be focused on  User Creation & Friend Requests. Angular.js 
will be used for creating the front end of the web application. Node.js + Express.js will be used 
for the back end of the web application. Node.js + Espress.js will be the link between the database 
and the front end. Ionic Framework will be used for adding mobile application elements and features
to the web application.

  There will be at least 2 group meetings during the 2 weeks for the first sprint. The first meeting 
will be on October 1. We’ll be discussing  tasks for overall project development and starting app 
development. For the second meeting, on September 8, we’ll be continuing app development and discussing
